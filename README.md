Game Description:

Additional Notes:
  -Couldn't Get SFML to automatically work within main for all of us as a group collectively, so Tuan had main branch, Tyler had dev_tyler, Ashton had dev_Ashton, and Brandon had dev_Brandon that way 
   they could compile their own work in their own branch without reconfiguring everytime whenever they'd work on the main branch. I (Tuan) would update their work into main by just copy and pasting 
   their work (Commits in main credit them respectedly)
