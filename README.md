Game Description:

  -The game was inspired or built off of the concept of a 2d platformer game such as Hollow Knight, where we aimed to produce aspects such as levels, platforms, enemies, hazard areas, and portals.
   Although, we were not able to build multiple levels and more freedom with platforms due to the not being able to figure out gravity for player and platforms, (such that the player can jump and will 
   land on the platform below it), instread we ran into a problem where the jumping aspect caused bugs/glitches within animation for the protagonist Character, with that limitation, we had to shift focus
   to having a flat platform where the player may go forward and backwards but never jumping as that'll create bugs within the application. Due to those limitations, we were only able to create the flat platforms    for the first and second level. Causing limitations of using things such as jumping platforms or jumping over hazard floors that'll send you back to respawn. 
   
  -Game Instructions
        the main goal of the game will be to pass the first floor (Top Floor of screen), in which is filled with enemies moving in either a vertical motion or horizontal motion. If you interact with them 
        by allowing you or the enemy sprites to touch you, then you will be respawned to the point of where you started off, after all the enemies, there will be a portal (blue color) that'll lead you to 
        the second level, where in the second level you'd have to out run the enemy present in the second level with timing while trying to get to the end portal at the end of the second level.
        
Additional Notes:

  -Couldn't Get SFML to automatically work within main for all of us as a group collectively, so Tuan had main branch, Tyler had dev_tyler, Ashton had dev_Ashton, and Brandon had dev_Brandon that way 
   they could compile their own work in their own branch without reconfiguring everytime whenever they'd work on the main branch. I (Tuan) would update their work into main by just copy and pasting 
   their work (Commits in main credit them respectedly)

  -@Andy
    When you git clone the repository to grade, it's likely that you wouldn't be able to compile due to SFML libraries that is linked to the visual studios are looking for a library that isn't in the 
    git repository, for example SFML3.0.0 graphics library might be found on one of the groupmates local desktop and wouldn't compile since it's looking for an SFML library that in one of our laptops
    Used this video to configure SFML: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvg8BXXWpCE
